<h1>My opinion on LGBTQ Comminity</h1>

<h2>Now, don't get me wrong. I do support the LGBT community. But I have some complains that I'd like make.</h2>
<br><br>
Before you read further, I would like to tell you if you have very strong beliefs on what you think is right, and you're reading this just to quarrel with me, then I would strongly recommend you to click off right now. Everyone has their own opinions and I do too. Y'all(people of LGBT community)  are the ones who vouch for it in the first place. 
<br><br>

!. Why is the community so loosely defined?<br><br>

> There are literally no rules whatsoever, leads to y'all being called out for supporting pedophiles.<br>
"Love is Love" is fine, but has it's limits. I under no humane circumstances will consider bestiality and pedophilia to be something a normal person might do, If you think it's fine, you need help.

2. Maybe make it clearer to the people?<br><br>
> You can not expect people to understand what you are when there are like 2 new genders added every second week.  <br>
Rather than making it simpler by making it "normal" y'all tend to make your gender a "selling point", of your whole personality.<br>
And something that I'd like to say to the peeps who say that "you deserve a better life and therefore you want reservation", reservations are for people with disabilities. and I think it's a mutual thought that this isn't a disability and rather just a natural thing.

3. I am trans-phobic. OR AM I?<br>
> People who NEED a surgery to let them have a normal life is fine and all, but the people who identify and "cat", "dog", "a fucking horse", etc. I see y'all as retarded fools.
